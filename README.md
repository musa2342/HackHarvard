# What inspired us
We are a team of passionate innovators who want to help you overcome the challenges of the hustle culture. This is the idea that you should always work hard and never stop, even if it means sacrificing your health and happiness[1](https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/life/work/hustle-culture). This culture can harm your well-being in many ways, such as causing sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx&ocid=msedgntp&cvid=876fa38075b34347a9f572d54897d660&ei=13). These factors can also increase your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that affects your memory and thinking skills[3](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-causes-alzheimers-disease#factors).

We were also inspired by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, a Buddhist teacher who taught us about the monkey mind. This is a term that describes the state of mind when you are easily distracted, restless, and anxious[5](https://www.stress.org/7-techniques-to-tame-monkey-mind). The monkey mind can prevent you from focusing on your goals and achieving them[6](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201709/calming-the-monkey-mind).

We also noticed that most people tend to use their phones too much when they have free time, which can also contribute to the monkey mind [7](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/screen-time-brain). Having a high screen time can affect your ability to relax and stop thinking[8](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2022/12/09/screen-time-the-good-the-healthy-and-the-mind-numbing/).

That’s why we created M<sup>2</sup> ood, a tech solution that helps you manage your monkey mind and improve your mood. M<sup>2</sup> ood stands for Monkey Mind Mood, and it is a website that integrates health data, mood tracking, and calendar to help you understand your overall mindset and well-being. Our solution helps you reduce screen time and become more aware of what is happening in your life and how you feel about it. We want to help you record, live, and enjoy the world, not just pass by.

# **Our Journey: Learning, Building, and Overcoming Challenges**

During this intense 36-hour hackathon, our team embarked on an incredible journey of learning, innovation, and collaboration. We delved into the world of HTML, CSS, Flask, Python, and APIs, broadening our technical horizons and bolstering our skills. 

## **What We Learned**

The hackathon served as an invaluable crash course in various technologies and team dynamics. We acquired proficiency in:

- **HTML and CSS:** Crafting visually appealing and responsive web interfaces.
- **Flask and Python:** Building the backbone of our project with efficient and dynamic web development.
- **API Integration:** A challenge we tackled head-on, enhancing our understanding of data interaction and retrieval.

Not only did we master the technical aspects, but we also honed essential team skills:

- **Communication:** Effective dialogue and knowledge sharing within our team.
- **Trust:** Relying on each other's expertise and judgment.
- **Cross-Functionality:** Leveraging diverse skill sets for a well-rounded approach.
- **Execution:** Translating ideas into tangible results.
- **Planning and Organization:** Structuring our efforts for maximum productivity.

## **Our Project Building Process**

Our project took shape through a combination of Flask, APIs, HTML, and CSS. We utilized Flask and Python to create a robust and responsive web application, ensuring our project met the desired standards for functionality and user experience.

## **The Challenges We Faced**

Undoubtedly, the most significant challenge we encountered was navigating the complex world of APIs. While platforms like Terra provided substantial support and user-friendly tools, the limited time frame imposed constraints. We aspired to integrate APIs more comprehensively, but time remained a constraint that we look forward to addressing in the future.

Additionally, we welcomed two teammates who were participating in a hackathon for the first time. Despite the steep learning curve, their dedication and adaptability allowed them to make a remarkable contribution in a short span. 

Our journey through this hackathon epitomized the spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity. It was an inspiring testament to the power of collaboration and the pursuit of knowledge in the face of challenges.
